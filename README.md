# SmartPlay

### SmartPlay is a Spigot plugin designed to bring a new and engaging learning method to the world of Minecraft. This unique plugin turns your gaming time into productive learning sessions. Players are presented with questions, created by you, which they have to answer correctly to survive in the game. It's learning with a twist, where answering wrong can literally kill you!

## Features

- Customizable Questions: Using the question generator at https://rogueram.club/smartplay, you can generate the content for the questions.json file.

- Engaging Gameplay: Players are presented with a GUI with a question. If the player answers the question wrong, they die; if they answer correctly, the game resumes.

- Countdown Timer: A 10-second countdown before each question is asked to allow the player to prepare.

- Mobs Freeze: While answering the questions, all the mobs around the player are frozen, all damage is prevented, and the player cannot move. Once the question has been answered, the player gets 3 seconds before all the mobs resume moving.
